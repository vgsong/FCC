freeCodeCamp.com Certification Challenges

Personal Repository for FCC challenges/certificates. 
I have learned a lot coding thanks for the FCC website. Eventually also learned (a bit) how to use github by uploading the FCC challenges themselves :)
I am by no mean a seasoned programmer (I do not have a Math background), however, I enjoy coding because it helps me a lot at work. It actually saved my career,
so I never stopped learning.

I have learned VBA through MS Excel, Python, JavaScript (which forgot most of it sadly) and a little bit of C. I am learning C because it helps me better understand Python.

Thank you for reading.
Keep learning
